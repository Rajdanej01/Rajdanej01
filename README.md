### 🚀 The "Elevator Pitch"

I am a **Data & Business Analyst** who believes data is useless unless it tells a story. 

I don't just sit in a dark room writing Python; I act as an **intellectual sparring partner** for stakeholders. I challenge assumptions, test logic, and prioritize **truth over agreement**. My goal isn't just to build a dashboard, but to build a tool that makes you money or saves you time.

* **My "Law of Attraction" for Data:** I visualize the decision you need to make, then I reverse-engineer the data pipeline to get you there.
* **Current Mission:** Deploying my full portfolio at `rajdane.online` and refining large-scale data cleaning pipelines for model testing.

### 🏆 Impact Locker (Featured Work)

*Real results. No fluff.*

#### 1. The "Time Saver" Protocol ⏱️
**Situation:** My team was drowning in 15+ hours of manual data cleaning every week.
<br>**Execution:** I wrote an automated Python pipeline to ingest, clean, and normalize the datasets automatically.
<br>**Result:** 🟢 **Reduced manual work by 40%**. We stopped cleaning data and started analyzing it.
<br>➡️ [**View Code**](LINK_TO_REPO)

#### 2. The Marketing "Money Maker" 💸
**Situation:** We were spending budget on ads but didn't know which ones actually worked.
<br>**Execution:** I built a Regression Model to analyze campaign performance and a Power BI dashboard to visualize it.
<br>**Result:** 🟢 Identified the winners, leading to a **22% increase in Click-Through Rate (CTR)** and a **15% boost in Conversions**.
<br>➡️ [**View Code**](LINK_TO_REPO)

#### 3. The Churn "Crystal Ball" 🔮
**Situation:** Customers were leaving, and we didn't know why until it was too late.
<br>**Execution:** I used Scikit-Learn to build a predictive model that flagged at-risk users based on their early behavior.
<br>**Result:** 🟢 Achieved **85% accuracy** in predicting churn, allowing the team to save those accounts.

### ⚡ Offline Mode (The Human Behind the Commit)

*My runtime isn’t limited to the terminal. Here’s how I debug my brain.*

| **Variable** | **Value / Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🏋️ **The Physical Algorithm** | **Progressive Overload, Clean Form.** I lift **5x/week**, track my numbers like KPIs, and treat consistency as the real “model performance.” Strong quads, stubborn calves, and yes, I’ve learned the hard way that Achilles tightness is a real bug, not a feature. |
| 🧭 **The Reset Function** | **Long Walks + Quiet Focus.** I can walk forever and think clearly. It’s my simplest reset: headphones on, ideas untangle, problems get smaller. Basically: meditation, but with steps. |
| 🧠 **The Operating System** | **Systems Thinking + Learning Science.** I’m big on structured learning and memory techniques (PACER style). I plan the analysis before I touch the data: define the question, define the metric, then build the pipeline. |
| 🥊 **Social Protocol** | **Truth-Seeking Conversations.** I’d rather be corrected than comforted. I enjoy debates that sharpen thinking, challenge assumptions, and force better logic. Small talk is fine, but I’ll always prefer “What’s the real story behind this?” over “How’s the weather?” |
| 📚 **Current Curiosities** | **Docs, Case Studies, and Weirdly Deep Rabbit Holes.** Business + economics + psychology + AI… and fictional universes that are hilariously impossible to survive in. It keeps me humble. |
| ⚡ **Fun Quirk** | I treat dashboards like products: if it isn’t usable, it isn’t done. And yes, I will refactor a chart the way some people refactor their life choices. |
