### 💼 Executive Profile

I am a **Data Analyst** who operates at the intersection of technical rigor and business strategy. My work focuses on removing ambiguity from decision-making processes. 

While many focus on the complexity of the code, I focus on the **clarity of the outcome**. I act as an **intellectual sparring partner** for stakeholders, using data not just to validate existing beliefs, but to uncover ground truth—even when it challenges the status quo. 

* **Current Objective:** Transitioning raw data into automated, high-fidelity insight systems that drive revenue and retention.
* **Core Competency:** Translating "messy" unstructured data into strict, decision-ready frameworks.

### 📂 Impact Case Studies

*Detailed breakdowns of recent strategic initiatives.*

#### 1. Automated ETL & Data Integrity Protocol
**The Challenge:** Critical model testing was bottlenecked by a manual cleaning process that consumed 15+ hours weekly, introducing human error and delaying deployment.
<br>**The Strategy:** Designed a self-correcting Python ETL pipeline to ingest, normalize, and validate datasets against strict quality schemas.
<br>**The Outcome:** * 🟢 **40% Reduction** in manual operational hours.
* 🟢 Eliminated data leakage, significantly improving model training reliability.
<br>➡️ [**View Architecture**](LINK_TO_REPO)

#### 2. Marketing ROI & Attribution Modeling
**The Challenge:** The marketing team was allocating budget based on intuition rather than channel performance, leading to inefficient spend.
<br>**The Strategy:** Deployed a regression analysis framework to isolate the performance of individual channels and visualized CAC vs. LTV in Power BI.
<br>**The Outcome:** * 🟢 **22% Increase** in Click-Through Rate (CTR) via targeted reallocation.
* 🟢 **15% Increase** in Conversion Rate by identifying high-intent user segments.
<br>➡️ [**View Analysis**](LINK_TO_REPO)

#### 3. Proactive Churn Detection Engine
**The Challenge:** Customer attrition was reactive; the business only knew a customer was unhappy *after* they cancelled.
<br>**The Strategy:** Built a logistic regression model utilizing early-stage behavioral data (usage frequency, support tickets) to flag at-risk accounts.
<br>**The Outcome:** * 🟢 **85% Accuracy** in identifying potential churners.
* 🟢 Enabled the Success Team to intervene weeks before cancellation events occurred.

### ⚡ Offline Mode (The Human Behind the Commit)

*My runtime isn’t limited to the terminal. Here’s how I debug my brain.*

| **Variable** | **Value / Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🏋️ **The Physical Algorithm** | **Progressive Overload, Clean Form.** I lift **5x/week**, track my numbers like KPIs, and treat consistency as the real “model performance.” Strong quads, stubborn calves, and yes, I’ve learned the hard way that Achilles tightness is a real bug, not a feature. |
| 🧭 **The Reset Function** | **Long Walks + Quiet Focus.** I can walk forever and think clearly. It’s my simplest reset: headphones on, ideas untangle, problems get smaller. Basically: meditation, but with steps. |
| 🧠 **The Operating System** | **Systems Thinking + Learning Science.** I’m big on structured learning and memory techniques (PACER style). I plan the analysis before I touch the data: define the question, define the metric, then build the pipeline. |
| 🥊 **Social Protocol** | **Truth-Seeking Conversations.** I’d rather be corrected than comforted. I enjoy debates that sharpen thinking, challenge assumptions, and force better logic. Small talk is fine, but I’ll always prefer “What’s the real story behind this?” over “How’s the weather?” |
| 📚 **Current Curiosities** | **Docs, Case Studies, and Weirdly Deep Rabbit Holes.** Business + economics + psychology + AI… and fictional universes that are hilariously impossible to survive in. It keeps me humble. |
| ⚡ **Fun Quirk** | I treat dashboards like products: if it isn’t usable, it isn’t done. And yes, I will refactor a chart the way some people refactor their life choices. |
